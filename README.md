How to use Simple FTP Client
=========================

* Download & compile the source code of the latest release, or download a binary

* Execute the .exe, and there you go!

* for all available commands type "help"

Silent option
===========

When uploading, downloading or viewing the files in a folder there are several print commands
to show the user what the program is doing. Otherwise it looks like the program is doing nothing.
If you don't want this, execute the command with "-silent" added to it.
