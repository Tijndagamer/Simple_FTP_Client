Simple FTP Client
===============

Simple FTP Client is a (obviously) simple command line based FTP client.

How to use Simple FTP Client
=========================

* Download & compile the source code of the latest release, or download a binary

* Execute the .exe, and there you go!

* for all available commands type "help"

Silent option
===========

When uploading, downloading or viewing the files in a folder there are several print commands
to show the user what the program is doing. Otherwise it looks like the program is doing nothing.
If you don't want this, execute the command with "-silent" added to it.

Logging
============

To log your actions in the ftp client, type "enable logging". Please be aware that this might
lower the speed of the program. To disable it type "disable logging".
Logging is disabled by default.
